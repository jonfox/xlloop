updates for 0.3.1
=================

- added round-robin connection mode for multiple servers in binary mode
- added retry ability to binary mode
- generic function category can be customized
- added ability to load INI keys from an external file
- added ability to load INI keys from the registry


todo
====


- need to make popup a dialog that isn't toplevel or on top of everything - just modal to the
  excel window
  
- support for multiple servers

	server.1.hostname=localhost
	server.1.port=80
	server.1.function=FS
	server.1.function.volatile=FSV
	server.2.protocol=http
	server.2.url=http://xlloop.appspot.com/functionserver
	server.2.function=GFS
	server.2.function.help=Generic function executor for Google deployment


Perhaps a better option:

providers=default,MDS,Test

[MDS]
hostname=...

[Test]
server=


- fix proxy support with auto config url (proxy.pac)
- implement real method overload support using defined overload resolution from java language spec
- 

INI option:
	- have extra "registry.override=true" then INI looks up from registry in
	   HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/XLLoop/xlloop.appspot.com-0.02/@url="http://d...."
	   
	 - also registry.override.path=HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/MyAddin/Tester 

if we use the above option, the user can customize a set of function streams etc.., store
this in the database and generate a unique key, then generate the .reg file to update
the user's registry for this customization...









xlloop datastore
=================



- jquantlib wrapper

- store data facility:
	XG.Save(tag, password, [data])
	XG.Load(tag)
	
	website can query for data based on a tag
	no password assumes public data, which is visible, writeable by anyone
	
- store hits on each bit of data so web front end can show popular data
- data with no password only lasts for x days/hours
- data with password lasts much longer (need to think about how long)
	- run cron jobs to clear out old data

- limit on IP address to X (eg. 20) saves per hour	

	
- maybe also have optional read password as well for private data
- google finance api
- bank of england
- us data gov


- provide access to google spreadsheets

* need a way to authenticate to google...


- server will contain a collection of functions (written in?)
	 - users can subscribe to channels of function
	 - they will create their own personalized function server with their selection of functions
	 	- http://xlloop.appspot.com/functionserver/user1
	 - need a way to generate an XLL based on this selection.
	 
	 - users could subscribe via a url eg:
	 	
		- http://xlloop.appspot.com/functionserver/channel1+channel2+myfuncs
		  this would grab the normal stuff plus channel1,channel1 and myfuncs.
		- will probably cause urls to get very large.


- function wiki - similar access controls as data store:
	users can upload a script with a given name, function help and a set of tags
	other users can then use this with customized url
	users can make function readonly with write password
	
	

	- start with FWiki("name", "pass", args...)


- front page snaz - 
	- have realtime scrolling down the screen, reads on lhs, writes on rhs. needs
	  to be dimmed out.


FunctionObject
	 - function information
	 - language
	 - text
	 - version
	 - timestamp
	 - timeout count  <- needs to be managed when a function takes up too much time (stops rogue functions)


scalability
===========

- add list of servers to connect to (either round robin or random selection)
- probably use list like (servers=localhost:5600,myserver,myserver:8000)
- create a proxy server that can multiplex requests out to child servers.

reliability
===========

- separate out scripting example/provider to separate jar to remove excess 
  dependencies

building/configuration
======================

- a version with 30 args (or build in support for say 10 functions that have
  more than 10 args)

protocols
=========

- http protocol version - ie. xmlcodec over http so php users can support this 
  natively
- add a way to add urls to the client (ini file is not user-friendly), maybe
  a registry based bookmark list
- date handling, maybe add support for exceldate object on object converter.
  
server/language support
=======================  

- haskell server?
 
addin support
=============

- add excel 2007 support
- open office calc extension?

xlloop-http
===========

rest apis

INI file

server.1=http://yahoo.com/FunctionServer
server.1.FunctionName=Yahoo
server.2=http://xlloop.com/CommonServer
server.2.FunctionName=XLLoop


server.1.FunctionName creates a function "Yahoo", which takes the normal "FS" arguments.

normal FSW (web) function take FSW(url, name, args...)
or XLLoop(...)
XLLoopV(..)


Function Documentation
======================

allow functions to be specified in the INI file (with docs) eg

function.1=MyFunc,"Test a function",arg1,arg2,etc...
function.2=etc...


Random


- utilties for printing xl arrays
- array joinging, transposing
- handle method overloding
- tidy up deployment
	- remove jxll from xlloop jar
	- 1.5 compile
- add set(row, col, Object) to XLArray
- allow refelction function to take an array of XLoper (ie. like delegate setup)
- DelegateFunction, DelegateFunctionHandler
- set of unit tests for xll
- vbscript for excel (allow server to send register vbscript against toolbar command or function)
